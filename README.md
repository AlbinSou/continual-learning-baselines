## WORK IN PROGRESS - WE ARE SETTING THINGS UP

**This repository aims to make the latest results from the Continual Learning literature available to anyone.**

Here, you will find all the resources you need to reproduce some of the most popular Continual Learning papers and strategies. From configuration files to Python environments, we make sure that running the experiments is as easy as possible.

To guarantee fair implementations, we rely on the **[Avalanche](https://github.com/ContinualAI/avalanche)** library, developed and maintained by *[ContinualAI](https://www.continualai.org/)*.
